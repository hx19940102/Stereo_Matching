# Stereo_Matching

Based on the result of Jure Å½bontar, Yann LeCun: [Stereo Matching by Training a Convolutional Neural Network to Compare Image Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05970), I further improve the quality and the accuracy of the disparity map calculated by convolutional neural network based on my own algorithm.
